# RSReforged

> **GMC fork 5.0.0-gmc** — personal fork for Foundry V14 (14.367+) and dnd5e 6.0.x. It has no
> `manifest`/`download`, so Foundry's "Update All" skips it; update it by hand.
>
> What differs from upstream RSReforged:
> - **Look:** every card RSR produces uses dnd5e 6's compact chat style. Attack, damage and formula rows on a usage card are rendered with dnd5e's own `attack-card`, `damage-card`, `roll-compact` and `card-rows` templates, and damage uses dnd5e's native `<damage-application>` tray. Standalone checks, saves, death saves, damage and healing stay dnd5e's native cards; RSR only decorates them.
> - **Multiroll (default on):** normal d20 rolls are evaluated as `2d20kf` (keep first; `kf` is a die modifier RSR registers on dnd5e's `D20Die`). The ignored die is shown dimmed next to the natural d20 and in the breakdown.
> - **Roll breakdown actions:** click a roll total to open its breakdown; the owner/GM gets **+ Bonus** on every roll, **Disadvantage / Normal / Advantage** on d20 rolls (uses the second d20; updates total, crit/fumble and hit/miss pills), and **Critical** on RSR card damage.
> - **Fast-forward:** rolls skip their configuration dialog unless the dnd5e "Skip Dialog" key (Shift) is held; Alt/Ctrl keep their dnd5e meaning. dnd5e 6.0.3 has no built-in setting for this, so RSR sets `dialog.configure` in `dnd5e.preRoll*V2` / `dnd5e.preUseActivity` (explicit values from macros or other modules win). Client setting *Fast-Forward Rolls (Shift to Configure)*.
> - **One card when configured:** Shift-using an activity shows the usage, attack and damage dialogs one after another, but every result lands on the single usage card. A cancelled dialog leaves dnd5e's button on the card; clicking it rolls onto the same card.
> - **Private rolls:** GM/blind/self rolls are hidden completely from players who may not see them (no "???" card, no summary line in a usage card). GMs get an eye button to reveal a message to everyone.
> - **Damage tray:** in the multiplier row, "-1" is a heart (healing), "2" shows the damage type icon, and an hourglass applies the total as temporary HP. Works on every dnd5e damage tray.
> - Debug helpers: `game.modules.get("rsreforged").api.debug` (`inspect(messageId?)`, `settings()`, `enable(true)`, `trayPatched()`, `multirollModifier()`, `itemUseWrapped()`).
> - Integration hooks now pass plain `HTMLElement`s (no jQuery); `rsreforged.renderRoll` passes an array of the inserted elements; `rsreforged.renderApplyDamageButtons` no longer fires.

> Quality-of-life roll automation for Foundry VTT's D&D 5e system.

## What it does

RSReforged removes clicks from D&D 5e rolls in Foundry VTT.

- **One-click rolls.** Skill checks, saves, attacks, and damage go to chat without the usual dnd5e dialog.
- **Damage split by type.** If an attack deals fire and cold, apply each to different tokens.
- **Edit rolls after they land.** Turn a flat roll into advantage, promote a hit to a crit, or add a Bless die you forgot.

## Compatibility

| | Minimum | Verified |
|---|---|---|
| Foundry VTT | **14.367** | 14.368 |
| dnd5e system | **6.0.0** | 6.0.3 |

This build (4.13.4-dnd5e6.x) is ported to dnd5e 6's typed chat messages and does not support dnd5e 5.x; use RSReforged 4.13.4 with dnd5e 5.3. **RSReforged does not work on Foundry v13** or **dnd5e 5.0–5.2**. If you're on those versions, stay on [upstream RSR v3.5.0](https://github.com/MangoFVTT/fvtt-ready-set-roll-5e/releases/tag/release-3.5.0) until you upgrade.

RSReforged also conflicts with other modules that overhaul the dnd5e roll pipeline, most notably [Midi-QOL](https://gitlab.com/tposney/midi-qol). They will fight each other in unpredictable ways. Pick one.

Modules that **decorate** chat cards (rather than rewriting the roll pipeline) — Automated Conditions 5e, Automated Weapon Masteries 5e, and similar — can coexist with RSReforged by listening to the [Integration API](#integration-api-for-module-authors) hooks instead of Foundry's `renderChatMessageHTML`. Upstream support depends on those modules adopting the hooks.

## Install

In Foundry's *Add-on Modules → Install Module* dialog, paste this into the **Manifest URL** field:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arrowedisgaming/RSReforged/master/module.json
```

Click *Install*. Foundry downloads the latest release and adds RSReforged to your module list.

## Features

### Quick rolls

Skill checks, ability checks, saving throws, tool checks, and item activities all roll straight to chat without the standard dnd5e dialog. Each category can be toggled independently in the module settings, or disable everything in one place with the *Use Vanilla Rolls with RSReforged Styling* master switch at the top — when that's on, dnd5e's normal roll dialogs are used everywhere and the per-category toggles are ignored. Hold the dnd5e *Skip Dialog* modifier (Shift by default) to invert RSReforged's quick-roll default and use the normal dnd5e dialog for one roll.

For weapons with the Ammunition property, quick rolls prefer the first available equipped ammunition item. When no ammunition is equipped, RSReforged reuses the last usable ammunition used for that weapon's attack, then falls back to the first available option. Hold the **Skip Dialog** modifier (Shift by default) to choose a different ammunition type for one attack; dnd5e records it as the last-used option.

Hold the *Advantage* or *Disadvantage* modifier while clicking to roll in that mode, including any extra dice from features like Elven Accuracy. The chat card highlights the kept die.

### Always roll two dice

A setting shows two d20s on every roll (three with Elven Accuracy), even without advantage or disadvantage. Hold a modifier to designate which die is kept.

### Edit rolls after they land

Upgrade a quick roll after it's been made: turn a flat roll into advantage or disadvantage, promote a hit to a critical, or change which die is kept. The chat card updates in place and shows the new state next to the old.

### Apply damage per target

Each damage and healing field in a quick-roll chat card has its own apply button (overlay on hover, or always-on per setting). Apply each damage type to selected or targeted tokens independently. Useful for "this 1d8 is fire and that 1d4 is cold and only one of them resists."

### Add a bonus after the roll

A `+` icon on every rolled card opens a dialog to add a bonus to the check, save, attack, or damage after it's rolled. You can type a **custom formula** (e.g. `1d4`, `+2`, `1d6 + @prof`), or pick a **pre-defined bonus** you've registered on an Active Effect.

See [Setting up pre-defined bonuses](#setting-up-pre-defined-bonuses) below for how to register them.

### Clickable dice in chat

With this feature enabled, you can click any die shown in a chat tooltip:

- **Left-click** a die in a roll you made to reroll that die in place. The chat card recalculates. If Dice So Nice is installed, the rerolled die is animated in 3D; otherwise the configured dice sound plays as a fallback. A public chat message logs the reroll (e.g. *"Alice rerolled a d20: 7 → 14"*), respecting the current roll mode.
- **Right-click** a die (GM only, when *Allow GM Dice Fudging* is on) to set its value via a prompt. Useful for narrative course-correction. Fudging is intentionally silent.

Settings that gate the feature:

- **Enable Interactive Dice (Master Switch)** — kill switch for the whole feature
- **Allow Players to Reroll Their Own Dice** — players can left-click their own dice
- **Allow GM Dice Fudging** — GM gets the right-click "set value" option
- **Reroll Sound & Dice So Nice** — play sound + animate rerolled die in 3D when Dice So Nice is installed
- **Log Rerolls to Chat** — post a public chat message announcing each reroll

## Configuration

All settings live under *Configure Settings → Module Settings → RSReforged*. The ones worth knowing:

- **Quick Roll for {Skills, Abilities, Tools, Activities}** — toggle each category independently
- **Always Roll Multiple Dice** — show two d20s on every roll, not just advantage or disadvantage
- **Hide NPC Roll Results** — for actors players don't own, hide modified totals on d20 rolls so only the natural die shows; choose Off, NPC attacks only, or all NPC d20 rolls (damage always visible)
- **Hidden Roll Style** — when a roll is hidden (see above), choose whether to mask the total and show the natural d20 (**Hide Total**, default) or show the final total while masking the die value and modifiers (**Hide Breakdown**)
- **Manual Damage Mode** — require an explicit click to roll damage, instead of auto-rolling on hit
- **Damage Apply UI** — choose dnd5e's per-target tray or RSReforged's quick apply buttons
- **RSReforged Apply Button Targets** — selected vs. targeted tokens, with priority modes for the RSReforged quick-button UI
- **Confirm Retroactive {Advantage, Crits}** — gate retroactive edits behind a confirm dialog

## Setting up pre-defined bonuses

This is optional. Use it when you want Bless, Bardic Inspiration, Guidance, and similar to appear as one-click options in the Bonus Manager instead of typing the formula each time.

Add an Active Effect change on the actor (or on an item that grants the effect) with:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Attribute Key | `flags.rsreforged.bonus` |
| Change Mode | *Custom* |
| Effect Value | A semicolon-delimited string (see below) |

Effect Value format:

```
<formula>; type:<roll-type[,roll-type...]>; random:<type,type,...>; consume:<origin|item-id|item-name>; once
```

| Token | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `<formula>` | A Roll formula. May reference `@actor.system.*` etc. Omit it alongside a damage-type token to add `0` of that type — a pure type tag. |
| `type:check` | Ability, skill, tool, and initiative checks |
| `type:save` | Saves, including death saves and concentration |
| `type:attack`, `type:damage`, `type:initiative` | That roll type only |
| `type:any` (default) | Any roll type |
| `<damageType>` | A bare dnd5e damage type (e.g. `fire`). Fixes the bonus to that type on damage rolls — no dialog, no randomness. |
| `random:<type,type,...>` | On a damage roll, pick one of the listed types at random each time the bonus is applied. |
| `choice:<type,type,...>` | On a damage roll, show a dropdown of the listed types in the bonus dialog so the player picks. |
| `consume:origin` | Consume one charge of the originating item when applied |
| `consume:<id-or-name>` | Consume one charge of a different item |
| `once` | Delete the effect after a single use |

Damage-type tokens accept dnd5e damage type keys (`acid`, `cold`, `fire`, `force`, `lightning`, `necrotic`, `poison`, `psychic`, `radiant`, `thunder`, `bludgeoning`, `piercing`, `slashing`). They apply only to damage rolls; on any other roll type the bonus is added untyped. (For example, `2d6; type:check, damage; lightning` adds 2d6 to a skill check, or 2d6 lightning damage to a damage roll.)

Examples:

- **Bless:** `1d4; type:check, save, attack` (no consumption, since Bless is a duration spell)
- **Bardic Inspiration (d8):** `1d8; type:check, save, attack; consume:origin; once`
- **Guidance:** `1d4; type:check; consume:origin; once`
- **Fixed type — extra necrotic:** `1d6; type:damage; necrotic` (always adds 1d6 necrotic to damage rolls)
- **Player choice — elemental weapon:** `1d8; type:damage; choice:acid, cold, fire, lightning, thunder` (dropdown in the bonus dialog; the player picks the type)
- **Random type — wild surge:** `1d6; type:damage; random:fire, cold, lightning` (a different one of the three each time it's applied)
- **Type-only tag (no dice):** `type:damage; fire` (adds `0` fire — tags the roll as fire damage without changing the total)

## Known issues

- **Typed damage splitting** (separate visual chips for `1d8[fire] + 1d4[cold]`) isn't in the current release. It was intended to ship when the fork started, but the implementation file was missing from the source PR. It may land in a future release.
- See the [issue tracker](https://github.com/arrowedisgaming/RSReforged/issues) for everything else.

## Integration API (for module authors)

RSReforged emits a small set of public hooks so other modules can decorate its chat cards without racing Foundry's render lifecycle. Full reference, contract rules, and worked examples in [`docs/INTEGRATION.md`](https://github.com/arrowedisgaming/RSReforged/blob/master/docs/INTEGRATION.md).

| Hook | When it fires | Args |
|---|---|---|
| `rsreforged.preRenderChatMessageContent` | Before RSR strips the dnd5e card | `(message, html, type)` |
| `rsreforged.renderChatMessageContent` | After RSR finishes its DOM rewrite — primary decoration point | `(message, html, type)` |
| `rsreforged.renderRoll` | After each attack / damage / formula section is inserted | `(message, html, type, sectionHtml)` |
| `rsreforged.renderApplyDamageButtons` | After the damage-apply UI is wired up | `(message, html, buttonsHtml)` |

Three rules: hooks are **synchronous** (no awaiting), listeners must be **idempotent** (re-renders re-fire the chain), and `preRender` may fire without a matching `render` (RSR sometimes merges child rolls into a parent and deletes the child).

```js
// Minimal example: annotate save buttons with a custom tooltip after every render.
Hooks.on("rsreforged.renderChatMessageContent", (message, html, type) => {
    html.find('button[data-action=rollSave]')
        .attr('data-tooltip', myTooltipFor(message));
});
```

## Credits

RSReforged is a maintained fork of [Ready Set Roll for D&D5e](https://github.com/MangoFVTT/fvtt-ready-set-roll-5e) by [MangoFVTT](https://github.com/MangoFVTT), itself a rewrite of [Better Rolls for 5e](https://github.com/RedReign/FoundryVTT-BetterRolls5e) by [RedReign](https://github.com/RedReign). The fork started in early 2026 to keep the module working on Foundry v14 and dnd5e 5.3; the compatibility work came from [PR #619](https://github.com/MangoFVTT/fvtt-ready-set-roll-5e/pull/619) by [maxobremer](https://github.com/maxobremer). Huge thanks to all three.
