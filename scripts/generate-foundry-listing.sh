# Regenerate docs/foundry-listing.html from README.md.
#
# Foundry's package listing description field accepts HTML
# (https://foundryvtt.com/article/packaging-guide/) but there is no public
# API for updating it — the listing gallery and description are hand-edited
# via the form at https://foundryvtt.com/packages/rsreforged (Edit mode).
#
# This script keeps a paste-ready HTML artifact under version control so the
# listing can be updated by copy-pasting docs/foundry-listing.html instead
# of hand-converting Markdown each release.
#
# Three transforms are applied on top of the raw marked output:
#   1. Strip the <h1>RSReforged</h1> — Foundry shows the package name above
#      the description already.
#   2. Strip the shields.io badges paragraph — Foundry surfaces version,
#      compatibility, and license through its own UI.
#   3. Rewrite the #setting-up-pre-defined-bonuses in-page anchor to an
#      absolute github.com link, since marked does not emit id= attributes
#      on headings and the anchor would otherwise be dead on Foundry's page.
#
# Dependencies: npx (Node.js). marked is pulled on demand via `npx --yes`
# so there is no local install to maintain.
